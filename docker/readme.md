# DevOps Microservice Lumen Project
[build] [stable]

[version] [v0.0.3 beta]

##### Why use it?
>Microservice Lumen allows you to start with a solid base for the construction of your back end, through the use of packages, services and patterns you can implement your app easily and efficiently.
With this framework you can implement your REST APIs in just a few steps using artisan commands to create the Controller, the Repository connected to the data model and the Transformer for displaying data.
The microservice communicates with the outside through api http calls with JWT authentication (stateless token). Implement basic services for API controllers, for responses, and helpers.
